# Testing in React 

When developing new applications, writing test code can feel unnecessary or even like a
burden. The focus is typically on building features quickly, and tests are often postponed or
overlooked. However, as the application grows and evolves, this mindset can become
problematic.

During the maintenance phase — especially when adding new features — you’re likely to
encounter unexpected bugs. Each new change increases complexity, and without a safety net of
tests, identifying and fixing issues becomes more difficult. Before long, what seemed like a
simple addition can lead to a cascade of bugs, slowing development and eroding confidence in
the codebase.

Valuable tests help manage this complexity, acting as a safeguard against regressions and a
guide for future development.

## Testing observable behaviors

One of the key characteristics of valuable tests is a low chance of producing false positives.
This is arguably the most important trait, as persistent false positives are one of the primary
reasons development teams lose trust in — and eventually abandon — automated testing
altogether.

A false positive occurs when a test fails even though the application is functioning correctly. In
essence, it reflects test fragility. The more frequently tests fail without an actual problem in the
code, the less confidence developers have in the test suite.

False positives commonly arise during code refactoring or when implementing new features.
These failures typically occur when tests are tightly coupled to implementation details, making
even minor internal changes trigger test failures.

To reduce the chance of false positives, it's essential to decouple tests from implementation
details and instead focus on observable behavior — what the system does from an external
perspective, rather than how it does it internally.

## Observable behaviors in React

In React, you don't manipulate the UI directly. Instead, you describe what the UI should look
like based on the current state — a pattern known as declarative UI programming. This
approach allows React to handle UI updates automatically as the state changes, making your
application less error-prone compared to imperative DOM manipulation.

But does this mean you should write tests that check component state? Not exactly. In modern
React testing — particularly when using libraries like React Testing Library (RTL) — it's
recommended to avoid testing internal state directly. State is considered an implementation
detail and should not be the focus of your tests.

Instead, tests should verify observable behavior — the things a user can see and interact with.
This means simulating real user interactions (like clicking or typing) and asserting on the
resulting UI changes.

Consider a typical interaction in a Todo application: adding a new task. From the user's
perspective, the key observable behavior is clicking the Add button to submit the task. This
interaction can be effectively tested using the Arrange–Act–Assert (AAA) pattern, which
breaks the process into three clear steps:

1. Arrange: Locate the input field and enter the task description.
2. Act: Click the Add button to add the task.
3. Assert: Verify that the new task appears in the task list.

Focusing on this kind of observable behavior — rather than internal component logic — leads to
more meaningful and resilient tests.

## Understanding Unit, Integration, E2E tests

The definition of a "unit" can vary depending on the testing philosophy — particularly between
the classic and mockist styles. This tutorial follows the classic style of unit testing.

A unit test is defined by the following characteristics:
- It verifies a single unit of behavior.
- It runs quickly.
- It is isolated from other tests and external systems.

A test is considered an integration test if it fails to meet any of the criteria above. Integration
tests aim to replicate the production environment as closely as possible. In practice, they
typically validate how your system behaves when working with out-of-process dependencies
— such as databases, APIs, or message queues.

An end-to-end (E2E) test is a specific subset of integration tests. These are often referred to as
broad integration tests, as they involve:
- Live versions of all services.
- A fully operational test environment with network access.
- Full execution paths across multiple services, not just individual integrations.

While E2E tests provide the highest fidelity to production, they are often slow and complex to
maintain. As an alternative, combining narrow integration tests with contract tests allows
you to validate interactions with external services without requiring a live instance. This
approach offers confidence in integration while maintaining test speed and reliability.
